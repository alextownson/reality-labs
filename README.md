[Reality Labs](https://alextownson.github.io/reality-labs/dist/) tells a brief history of the company. The project was born out of the desire to learn Three.js. This is the first project I have made using the Three.js library. It is also the first project I've made that uses GSAP. 

## Development 

A specific skill I wanted to practice within this project is working with imported 3D models. I found the Quest 2 headset model on Sketchfab. Once I had the headset imported, I had the idea to control the position with user scroll. This led me to import and learn GSAP. The design of the website followed my development goals. The gradients and dialogue box were inspired by the Quest 2 UI.

For the "history" portion of the website, I made use of planes and texture mapping to show the website windows containing information about Reality Labs. This is an area I am still working on. I found the Three.js documentation on 3D text a bit confusing and I do not think I have implemented it correctly for the headings. Furthermore I would like learn how to use the Raycaster, which allows mouse selection of 3D objects. This would replace the HTML links as it would allow a user to interact with the website windows directly. 

## Responsive Design

My current implementation of a window resize event listener does not appear to be working correctly. I will have to learn more about resizing in Three.js to ensure usability on various devices.
